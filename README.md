The first notebook creates scatter plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude:
* Latitude vs. Temperature
* Latitude vs. Humidity
* Latitude vs. Cloudiness
* Latitude vs. Wind Speed
Then, those relationships are computed by Linear Regression for Each Relationship

The second deliverable uses the same weather data to map potential vacation locations. The notebook creates a map that displays a point for every city in the data frame,with the name of the first hotel within 10,000 meters from given coordinates. All pertinant information shows up in the hover menu.
